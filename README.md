# tic-tac-toe_gameConsole
Simple Tic-Tac-toe game for 2 players via console. (study task)

Rules same as for default tic-tac-toe, but:
You and your opponent have to press 1-9 (and nothing else) button in turn. 
Cross always moves first.

Possible results:
Cross win.
Zero win.
Draw.

Note, please:
This is my first "one-night project" on C# made as a home task for courses.
Nothing special for novice (accept "State" Pattern).
